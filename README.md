# Boardinator == Board Coordinator (get it?!?!)

Boardinator is task management software used by [Santa Barbara
Hackerspace](http://sbhackerspace.com) to help our Board coordinate
more goodly.

Boardinator tracks which tasks our Board members have _been_ assigned
and _have_ assigned to other members of the 'space, then does useful
things with that information (e.g., sends reminder emails to the
assignee, emails the Board when a task is not completed on time, etc).
