# Boardinator == Board Coordinator (get it?!?!)

Boardinator is task management software used by [Santa Barbara
Hackerspace](http://sbhackerspace.com) to help our Board coordinate
more goodly.

Boardinator tracks which tasks our Board members have _been_ assigned
and _have_ assigned to other members of the 'space, then does useful
things with that information (e.g., sends reminder emails to the
assignee, emails the Board when a task is not completed on time, etc).


## Quickstart

### Postres Setup

The following instructions are for Postgres 8.4 and 9.1, and should be
almost identical for newer versions.

In command line shell (probably Bash):

```
sudo su postgres
createuser boardinator  # answer `n` to each of the 3 questions
```

Newer versions of Postgres require `createuser --interactive
boardinator` instead.

In Postgres shell (transition with `psql` command):

```
CREATE DATABASE boardinator;
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    Id             varchar(36) NOT NULL,
    Name           varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    Description    varchar(4096),
    DueDate        timestamp with time zone,
    Assignee       varchar(100),
    Completed      boolean NOT NULL,
    CompletionDate timestamp with time zone
);
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tasks TO boardinator;
ALTER ROLE boardinator WITH PASSWORD 'boardinator';
```


### Create New Task

```
curl -X POST -d \
'{"name": "Boardinator MVP", "due_date": "2014-03-22T17:30:00-07:00", "assignee": "elimisteve@gmail.com", "description": "Finish API Task creation"}' \
http://localhost:6060/api/tasks
```


### Update Task

`curl -X PUT -d '{"completed":true}' http://localhost:6060/api/tasks/49ebc56f-dfdb-4a11-4d9c-d83d488f987a`


### Get Task

`curl -X GET http://localhost:6060/api/tasks/49ebc56f-dfdb-4a11-4d9c-d83d488f987a`

or simply

`curl http://localhost:6060/api/tasks/49ebc56f-dfdb-4a11-4d9c-d83d488f987a`


### Delete Task

`curl -X DELETE http://localhost:6060/api/tasks/49ebc56f-dfdb-4a11-4d9c-d83d488f987a`

### AngularJS Dependencies installation
